# Expressive Cryptography ft. Brainbox

Expressive Cryptography ft. Brainbox is an interactive GUI where the user can implement and play around with different cryptographic primitives, using which various cryptographic protocols can be built. This extended GUI interface, adopted from Brainbox, simulates primitives like hashing (eg., SHA256), HMAC, AES and Elliptical Curve. The author lessons made available on this platform will walk the user through different complex schemes that are pre-built, explaining the implementation and functionality of each of them. This GUI does not require any extensive prerequisite knowledge of cryptography or programming. It is designed in a way that allows the user to drag-and-drop different components, connect them and view the resulting output of their custom design.
