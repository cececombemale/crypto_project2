It is possible to create formatted text or circuits and to organize them into chapters.\n\nAs already mentioned, the basis for this is the formatting language Markdown\n\n\n## What's Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.\n\nUsing Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\n\n## Markdown quick reference\nDouble-click on this page to see how the formating happends\n\n\n# h1 Heading\n## h2 Heading\n### h3 Heading\n#### h4 Heading\n##### h5 Heading\n###### h6 Heading\n\n## Emphasis\n\n**This is bold text**\n\n__This is bold text__\n\n*This is italic text*\n\n_This is italic text_\n\n~~Strikethrough~~\n\n\n## Lists\n\nUnordered\n\n+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`\n+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:\n  - Marker character change forces new list start:\n    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at\n    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\n    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit\n+ Very easy!\n\nOrdered\n\n1.
